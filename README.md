Private_Program:
I would like to develop a simple program that appeals to brain impaired individuals.
The objective of the program is to engage the user as much as possible but to test
her/his perception, reaction, and understanding as quickly as they are able to respond
and that I am able to measure it. I will be asking questions and recording the time
taken to respond by using an on-screen timer that records hh:mm:ss.
